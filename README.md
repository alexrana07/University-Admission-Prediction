# 🎓 University Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the probability of a student getting admitted to a university using machine learning techniques.  
It uses **Linear Regression** to analyze academic and profile-based factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and research experience.

The goal is to help students make informed decisions and demonstrate the application of data science in education.
